Iranian Threat Agent Greenbug Impersonates Israeli High-
Tech and Cyber Security Companies
clearskysec.com /greenbug/
Iranian Threat Agent Greenbug has been registering domains similar to those of Israeli High-Tech and Cyber
Security Companies.
On 15 October 2017 a sample of ISMdoor was submitted to VirusTotal from Iraq. The sample name
was WmiPrv.tmp (f5ef3b060fb476253f9a7638f82940d9) and it had the following PDB string:
C:\Users\Void\Desktop\v 10.0.194\x64\Release\swchost.pdb
Two domains were used for command and control:
thetareysecurityupdate[.]com
securepackupdater[.]com
By pivoting off the registration details and servers data of the two domains we discovered others registered by the
threat agent. Eight contain the name of Israeli high-tech and cyber security companies and one of a Saudi Arabian
testing & commissioning of major electrical equipment company.
We estimate that the domains were registered in order to be used when targeting these companies, organisations
related to them, or unrelated third parties. However, we do not have any indication that the companies were actually
targeted or otherwise impacted.
Below are the malicious domains and the companies who’s names were used.
